# Classify_Age
This Phyton program categorizes a person based on their age using an if-elif-else structure. I created this by only using Thonny, and a handout that was given to me by my professor.
In this activity, students will write a function that categorizes a person based on their age using an if-elif-else structure. The function, named classify_age(age), will take an age as input and classify individuals into four groups: Child (0-12 years), Teen (13-19 years), Adult (20-64 years), and Senior (65+ years). If an invalid age (negative number) is entered, the function should print an appropriate message. Students will call this function multiple times with different age values to observe how the program categorizes different individuals. For example, calling classify_age(8) should print "You are a Child.", while classify_age(70) should print "You are a Senior.". This exercise will help students understand function definitions, parameter usage, and conditional statements in Python.
